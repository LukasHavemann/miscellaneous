Hello, 

at first: We really enjoy working with Kibana! It's a great peace of software!

But we think there is a little bug in it. The zip file contains some sample data and a preconfigured dashboard. 
We also added a edited screenshot that shows what we would expect to happen if you activate all pinned querys on the dashboard.

Just active/deactive some of the pinned querys and look at the histogramms.

We think its the same bug as galindro mentioned in issue #758. 	

Best regards,
Lukas Havemann
